        Hello! I am a senior CS major. I am Vietnamese.
        This is my last semester, I hope that I am able to make it through. I am looking
        forward to going to Vietnam after graduation. I transferred to SFSU from Ohlone and SFCC.
        I have two dogs. I haven't had much free time since school started but when i do have it
        I enjoy playing video games and flying kites. I hope to make a significant contribution to
        RecipeReels.
